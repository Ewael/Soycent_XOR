README

    This is a XOR neural network developed by the SOYCENT team during the OCR
    development in order to understand the basics of neural networking. This
    C language program creates and trains a XOR neural network. Inputs can be
    directly changed in the source code.

USAGE

      ./main
        Generates the neural network, prints its results before and after the
        training for every possible inputs, and the output of a single pair of
        inputs considered as the 'user inputs'. It also shows the cost function
        and the average error of the network after its training.

COMPILING

  Download the XOR source code, then use the following:

      make

CURRENT STATUS

    The development of this XOR neural network is over.
